## The International Data Spaces Association on GitHub ðŸ‘‹

"The International Data Spaces Association is an association of over 140 members who share a vision of a world where all companies and every person can self-determine the usage rules of their data in secure, trusted, and equal partnerships. Their goal is to establish a global standard for international data spaces (IDS) while fostering related technologies and business models for open, federated data ecosystems and marketplaces that ensure data sovereignty for all participants.
As shown in the infographic below, IDS enables trusted data exchange between data providers and consumers. All IDS participants can trust each other because they adhere to a common trust framework. This framework specifies that everyone must use a specific data endpoint: the IDS Connector. To ensure that each IDS Connector behaves as intended, it is certified against security criteria along with any participant in data sharing. Based on this foundation of trust, IDS improves cooperation, lowers entry barriers, and enhances innovation for the future of the data economy."

Below are a few ways how you can start your journey into data spaces here on GitHub:

---

### Introduction | Rulebook :green_book:
In an era dominated by data-driven ecosystems and businesses, the development and operation of data spaces have become crucial for organizations seeking success and competitiveness. The [IDSA Rulebook](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDSA-Rulebook) plays a pivotal role in this landscape, serving multiple purposes that are instrumental in shaping the data space framework.
At its core, the [IDSA Rulebook](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDSA-Rulebook) aims to provide a clear delineation between mandatory rules and optional guidelines, encompassing functional, technical, operational, and legal dimensions. This governance framework lays down guidelines for common service functionalities, defining processes, and outlining specific roles and services within data spaces. In short, the [IDSA Rulebook](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDSA-Rulebook) stands as a comprehensive guide for navigating the complexities of data spaces, offering essential guidelines for data functionality, technical implementation, collaboration, and legal compliance. 
Join us in contributing to the development and enhancement of the IDS Rulebook. Your expertise and insights can make a significant impact on creating guidelines that foster innovation, collaboration, and compliance in data spaces.

### Introduction | Open-source :computer:
By embracing an open-source approach, our portfolio of IDS building blocks becomes a collaborative effort that empowers stakeholders to actively participate in shaping the future of data spaces, fostering trust, security, and innovation in data-driven environments.
In the open-source environment, collaborative creation thrives. It's agile, efficient, and fosters a culture of open ideas, contribution requests, and feedback. All stakeholders in IDS aspire for the highest quality implementations, and the IDS open-source landscape maximizes these possibilities.
By becoming a contributor, you'll be part of fruitful discussions. Engage with the community, review code, provide feedback, report bugs, and contribute to enhancing the quality and functionality of our IDS building blocks.

### Introduction | Discussions :speech_balloon:
GitHub Discussions is a fantastic collaborative communication forum designed for our IDS community. Unlike GitHub Issues, which are mainly for tracking code-related matters, Discussions are the perfect place for transparent and accessible conversations that don't necessarily need to be tracked on project boards.
With Discussions, we aim to foster a more fluid and open exchange of ideas in a public forum. It's a centralized space where you can connect with others, share your thoughts, ask questions, and find valuable information related to the project.
Your insights and input are invaluable to us, and we believe your active participation in these discussions will enrich the community's overall experience. We encourage you to join the conversation, share your expertise, and collaborate with fellow community members in shaping the future of our project.
To participate, simply head to [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa) and click on the [Discussions](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/discussions) tab. From there, you can start new discussions, comment on existing ones, or engage in conversations that interest you the most.
